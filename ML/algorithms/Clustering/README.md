# Clustering

Clustering is applied on a dataset to group similar sets of data points. It looks for similarities and dissimilarities in data points and clutters them together. There are no labels in clustering. Clustering is an unsupervised learning to find the underlying structure of the dataset.

Types of clustering algorithms:

- Partition-based clustering
- Fuzzy clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Grid-Based clustering
- Exclusive clustering
- Overlapping clustering
- Density-based clustering
